# @af/instant-scripts

This package is simply a collection of scripts that can be run without needing to do any yarn installation.

They either have no dependencies or only rely on dependencies that are preinstalled in our docker image.

This is just a temporary solution until we have a solid plan on how we want to handle these types of scripts.
