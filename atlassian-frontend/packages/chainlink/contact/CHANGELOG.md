### Patch Changes

- [`6c525a8229`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/6c525a8229) - Upgraded to TypeScript 3.9.6 and tslib to 2.0.0

  Since tslib is a dependency for all our packages we recommend that products also follow this tslib upgrade
  to prevent duplicates of tslib being bundled.
