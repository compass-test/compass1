## Usage

Use text areas to let users enter long-form plain text that spans over multiple lines and in an area that can expand in height. Text areas are normally used in [forms](/patterns/forms).
Common text area input types include plain text descriptions and messages.

## Anatomy

This is the anatomy of a text area in a form.
![Text area anatomy](images/anatomy.png)

1. ** Label: ** Indicates the type of information the text area requires and is left-aligned directly above the input area.
2. ** Placeholder text (optional): ** Clarifies how users should use the area, for example, “Add a message here.”
3. ** Input area: ** This is where users enter text.
4. ** Helper text: ** Gives context about an area’s input.

## Content guidelines

- Use a combination of a concise label and supportive helper text for clarification of field input. Don’t rely on placeholder text as it is not visible at all times.
- Place helper text above the text input (below the area label) if it is necessary to understand the field.
- Use a concise label to indicate what information goes in the text area input. The label should be a noun string. For example, if the text area appears in a modal called “Create component”, the label for a description text area should only say “Description” and not repeat the modal’s title.

## Accessbility

- Label attributes for screen readers should be included for users who use screen readers to understand what the text area relates to.
Follow the [accessibility](/foundations/accessibility) foundations for more guidance on accessible design.
