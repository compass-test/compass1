# Mono repo tooling

Sub directory monorepo tooling.
These tools will possible be moved to a different directory and/or scope.

## Why not use the `build/` dir

The build dir is mostly used for AK build tooling. The tooling in this directory is not necessarily for AK, but for our
consumers instead.
