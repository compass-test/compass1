# IntegrationsSurvey

The integrations survey consists of a grid like layout (grid behaviour to be discussed) of integrations (inside of buttons/toggles) with a checkbox decision, along with buttons below.

## IntegrationDetails

This component provides detail about a single integration. Shows the logo, and name of the integration. Accepts the id of the integration as a prop.

## IntegrationPicker

Wraps IntegrationDetails, and provides a way to select / unselect an integration.
