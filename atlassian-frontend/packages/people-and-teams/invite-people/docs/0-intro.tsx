## Intro

The Invite Component ensures a consistent, minimum friction invite experience for customers.

Behind the scenes, the Invite Component relies on identity's [Invite](https://id-public-api-facade.staging.atl-paas.net/api-explorer/#/default/post_invitations_invite) and [Invitation Capabilities](https://id-public-api-facade.staging.atl-paas.net/api-explorer/#/default/get_invitations_capabilities). If the user and the instance access settings allow, an invite will be sent to the new user, otherwise a request access will be created.
