# Instructions to developers duplicating this component

This component exists as a reference example for anyone creating a new restricted component. Get started by following these instructions:

1. Copy this package to your team's directory.
2. Edit the package.json. Reset the version to `0.0.0`. If you need to publish under the `@atlassiansox` scope update the name accordingly. There is no difference in configuration between `@atlassian` and `@atlassiansox` but note that we don't currently have a good process for hotfixing old versions of packages in a SOX-compliant way.
3. Remove the CHANGELOG.md file.
4. Delete this message.
