# UI layer

The primary goal of UI components is to render an interface. This is where all the composition is
happening: a UI component consumes other UI components, services and state controllers.

All components should be considered “black box” by other components, they can only interact with
each other explicitly via their external API and explicit exports. By doing that, we are optimising
for future refactoring and scalability, and encouraging separation of concerns. In the ideal
scenario, any component on any level of the hierarchy can be moved to any level above by a simple
drag-and-drop, including being extracted into its own package.

While in the past we were adhering to the concept of
[presentational/container](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)
components, it is now obsolete.

Because:

- when everything is a component and local state management is handled directly in components, the
  line between what is “presentational” and what is “container” is now very hard to define

- it interferes with the code readability and the flow of data, which is against patterns we are
  going for, where everything is composable

## Naming convention

All UI components should be structured in exactly the same way

- **/assets** _(optional)_ - images and other static resources required by this component.
- **/test-utils** _(optional)_ - this directory contains testing utilities, and should be used in
  rare cases when the `test-utils.js` file is becoming too large, complex, and unmanageable.
- **/utils** _(optional)_ - in rare cases when a component needs to do a lot of transformations or
  other operations, a single `util.js` is not enough. When this happens they can be put in a folder
  instead and separated into files. In this case, every util should be put into its own file with
  the name that reflects name of that util, and has unit tests in a separate file with the name
  name-of-the-util.test.js.
- **examples.js** _(optional)_ - render examples of usage of this component. See more details in
  [Examples for UI components](../components-and-hooks-patterns/writing-examples-and-stories.md).
  Although this file is marked as optional, it is highly encouraged to write examples for all UI
  components
- **constants.js** _(optional)_ - if a component requires to define a lot of constants they should
  be extracted into this file. There is no need to extract all constants right away though, use your
  best judgement here.
- **index.js** - usually contains the main logic of the component. It will compose different
  components, including various services/controllers, react context consumers and all other UI
  elements. Concerns that are not relevant for the actual component logic (like styles or
  translations, see the list below) should be extracted into their relevant files. When there is a
  need and when it make sense, it can re-export this component's public API for others to consume.
  Main logic of the component then will go into `main.js`.
- **main.js** _(optional)_ - main logic of the component if `index.js` is used for re-exporting
  public API.
- **messages.js** _(optional)_ - all translations for this component should be grouped here.
- **mocks.js** _(optional)_ - mocks of a component with different variations of data to use in tests
  or examples of UI components that consume this service. See more details in the
  [DI section](../components-and-hooks-patterns/dependency-injection.md).
- **styled.js** _(optional)_ - all styled components that are used in production code live there. It
  should not contain components that are used for test purposes.
- **test.js** _(optional)_ - unit tests for the component or its utils. It is recommended to write
  unit tests for all components that have logic worth testing. It is unnecessary to write unit tests
  for components that only render other component with no logic inside, since we also have types and
  examples to help with code coverage. Important: this file should contain actual unit tests, not
  shallow snapshots of the component with the description "component should render".
- **test-utils.js** _(optional)_ - testing utilities that are specific to this particular component.
- **test-utils.test.js** _(optional)_ - tests the testing utilities exposed in `test-utils.js`.
- **types.js** _(optional)_ - all types for this component live here. The only exception are Props
  and State, that could live in `main.js/index.js` if they are small enough.
- **utils.js** _(optional)_ - utils that are specific to this particular component.
- **utils.test.js** _(optional)_ - tests the utilities exposed in `utils.js`.

## Rules

### [import/no-parent-imports](/packages/eslint-plugin-tangerine/rules/import/no-parent-imports)

The below configuration restricts importing parent ui components within the 'ui' directory as per
[ui structure](../components-and-hooks-patterns/ui.md) guidelines.

#### Config

```js
'tangerine/import/no-parent-imports': [
  'error',
  {
    basePath: path.join(appRoot, 'src'),
    srcRoot: 'src',
    dirs: ['ui'],
    message:
      '\nSee https://github.com/atlassian/frontend/tree/master/guides/code/app/apps/structure/ui-layer for more details',
  },
],
```
