### @atlaskit/adf-schema@14.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`06fd53f5bc`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/06fd53f5bc) - ## TEMPORARY FIX: DELETE ME PRIOR TO MERGING INTO MASTER!

  This is a _temporary_ **fake** changeset to replicate the version bumps that occured in the [Yarn](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/13324/overview) release.

  This is necessary to re-align dependencies between the yet-to-be adopted Yarn release, and the upcoming Alpaca release.

  Since `develop` is a _superset_ of the previous release, it needs to contain the latest released package versions.
  In this case, it needs the versions from Yarn (renovate upgrade branch) instead of the versions from Xylene (confluence master).
  Because several packages had major version bumps, this leads to duplicates and instability within Confluence's yarn.lock.

  See https://atlassian.slack.com/archives/CPRKU0UJJ/p1601351825029900 for further context.

#### Minor Changes

- [`a41378f853`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/a41378f853) - Refactor & fix few cases of unsupported node attributes:

  - Preseve attributes on nodes which do not support any attributes
  - Add unsupportedNodeAttribute to bulletList, layoutSection etc.

#### Patch Changes

- [`e4abda244e`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/e4abda244e) - ED-9912: replace prosemirror-tables with editor-tables
- [`3e652479cc`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/3e652479cc) - ED-9912: use CellAttributes from editor-tables in adf-schema

### @atlaskit/media-client@12.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`06fd53f5bc`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/06fd53f5bc) - ## TEMPORARY FIX: DELETE ME PRIOR TO MERGING INTO MASTER!

  This is a _temporary_ **fake** changeset to replicate the version bumps that occured in the [Yarn](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/13324/overview) release.

  This is necessary to re-align dependencies between the yet-to-be adopted Yarn release, and the upcoming Alpaca release.

  Since `develop` is a _superset_ of the previous release, it needs to contain the latest released package versions.
  In this case, it needs the versions from Yarn (renovate upgrade branch) instead of the versions from Xylene (confluence master).
  Because several packages had major version bumps, this leads to duplicates and instability within Confluence's yarn.lock.

  See https://atlassian.slack.com/archives/CPRKU0UJJ/p1601351825029900 for further context.

### @atlaskit/modal-dialog@11.3.0

#### Minor Changes

- [`06fd53f5bc`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/06fd53f5bc) - ## TEMPORARY FIX: DELETE ME PRIOR TO MERGING INTO MASTER!

  This is a _temporary_ **fake** changeset to replicate the version bumps that occured in the [Yarn](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/13324/overview) release.

  This is necessary to re-align dependencies between the yet-to-be adopted Yarn release, and the upcoming Alpaca release.

  Since `develop` is a _superset_ of the previous release, it needs to contain the latest released package versions.
  In this case, it needs the versions from Yarn (renovate upgrade branch) instead of the versions from Xylene (confluence master).
  Because several packages had major version bumps, this leads to duplicates and instability within Confluence's yarn.lock.

  See https://atlassian.slack.com/archives/CPRKU0UJJ/p1601351825029900 for further context.

### @atlaskit/inline-dialog@13.0.8

#### Patch Changes

- [`06fd53f5bc`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/06fd53f5bc) - ## TEMPORARY FIX: DELETE ME PRIOR TO MERGING INTO MASTER!

  This is a _temporary_ **fake** changeset to replicate the version bumps that occured in the [Yarn](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/13324/overview) release.

  This is necessary to re-align dependencies between the yet-to-be adopted Yarn release, and the upcoming Alpaca release.

  Since `develop` is a _superset_ of the previous release, it needs to contain the latest released package versions.
  In this case, it needs the versions from Yarn (renovate upgrade branch) instead of the versions from Xylene (confluence master).
  Because several packages had major version bumps, this leads to duplicates and instability within Confluence's yarn.lock.
