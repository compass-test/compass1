### @atlaskit/checkbox@12.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`ee02ee0aaa`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/ee02ee0aaa) - In this version, we made `Checkbox` dramatically faster and more lightweight ðŸ˜

  ### Changes

  In `12.0.0` we improved the performance of `Checkbox` by making it more similar to a native checkbox and removing performance-heavy API.

  #### Overrides

  `overrides` is an API that allowed extreme customisation flexibility. Previously you could customise the css and attributes of 6 internal components or replace the component entirely.

  ```
  <Checkbox
   overrides={{
     IconWrapper: {
       cssFn: defaultStyles => {
         ...defaultStyles,
         transition: 'all 0.3 cubic-bezier',
        },
       component: SomeCustomComponent,
       attributes: { 'data-custom': true }
     }
   }}
  />
  ```

  This proved to be a significant performance problem even if you weren't using the API. It also exposes internal structure as external API which prevents us from changing the structure and improving the component. We found that not many consumers were using `overrides` so we decided to benefit all consumers of `Checkbox` we have removed `overrides` from the package. If you are using `overrides` and we haven't already been in contact with you, contact the design system team for assistance in migrating away from it.

  ### Theming

  `theme` is another API that allows you to customise the appearance of `Checkbox`. Theming could previously be used to customise the various colours, spacing and sizes used in `Checkbox`. Much like `overrides` there was minimal usage of this API and it was identified to have a negative performance impact regardless of whether it was used.

  We decided to also remove this API to benefit all consumers of `Checkbox`. If you would like to continue customising checkbox there are now two ways of doing this. `Checkbox` now spreads any `HTMLInputAttribute` onto the checkbox input. Therefore you can put a `className` on the checkbox input and target the svg that is actually being shown, in the exact same way that we target the svg based off checkbox styles. For example,

  ```
  import React from 'react';
  import { css } from '@emotion/core';
  import { Checkbox } from '@atlaskit/checkbox;

  export default function CustomStyleExample() {
    return (
      <Checkbox
        label="Custom style checkbox"
        css={css`
          & + svg {
            margin-left: -2px;
          }
        `}
      />
    )
  }
  ```

  You can also customise the size of the `Checkbox` with the size prop.

  ```
  import React from 'react';

  import { Checkbox } from '@atlaskit/Checkbox';

  export default function LargeSizeExample() {
    return (
      <Checkbox
        defaultChecked
        value="Large checkbox"
        label="Large checkbox"
        name="checkbox-basic"
        size="large"
        testId="large"
      />
    );
  }

  ```

  Note that `Checkbox` still supports the light mode / dark mode global token. Along with this change we have removed the exports `ComponentTokens` and `ThemeFn` from `Checkbox` as they can no longer be used with the removal of `theme`.

  #### Other changes

  - Previously all interaction styles were generated in JS using events, causing unnecessary and slow rerenders for actions like hovering and focusing. Now all styles for the `Checkbox` are applied using css selectors.
  - To generate less dom elements we have removed the dependency on `@atlaskit/icon` and instead changed to an `svg` that can be customised to be the default checkbox or the indeterminate checkbox. This `svg` is styled from the input element with the sibling selector.
  - The disabled state of `Checkbox` previously had no border. This was not intentional and now `Checkbox` has a 2px border when it is disabled, this is consistent with all other states of `Checkbox`.
  - `CheckboxProps` now extends `HTMLInputAttribute` which means you can pass any input attribute as a prop onto `Checkbox`.
  - Changed the `inputRef` prop to be `ref` which returns the `ref` of the checkbox input using `forwardRef`. This new `ref` prop will accept the type of the old `inputRef` prop, `(input?: HTMLInputElement) => any`, as well as if `ref` is created with `createRef`.
  - Removed the prop `isFullWidth` as it did not do anything.
  - Updated the entry point to only export `Checkbox` and `CheckboxProps`. `Checkbox` can now be a named or default import. As the old entry point allowed access to every export at the base level these exports have now been removed; `ComponentTokens`, `ThemeFn`, `CheckboxWithoutAnalytics`, `CheckboxIcon` as well as all exported types.
  - Changed indeterminate checkboxes to set `aria-checked` to be `mixed`.

  #### Automatic upgrading

  There is a codemod that assists you in upgrading most of the changes from above.

  - Removes `isFullWidth`, `theme` and `overrides` prop.
  - Shifts over usages of `inputRef` to `ref`
  - Removes imports of `ComponentTokens` and `ThemeFn`.
  - Changes imports of `CheckboxProps` to be at the base level.
  - Changes imports of `CheckboxWithoutAnalytics` to import `Checkbox` at the base level.

  ```
  ## You first need to have the latest `Checkbox` installed before you can run the codemod
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/checkbox@^12.0.0

  ## Run the codemod cli
  ## Pass in a parser for your codebase
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
  ```

#### Patch Changes

- [`f51a912369`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/f51a912369) - CMB-2437: Added VR tests for the Date node in both Editor and Renderer packages
- [`291910c1db`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/291910c1db) - [ux] ED-10741 Remove legacy UI/UX for heading anchor links.

  Nested header links is enabled using the `allowHeadingAnchorLinks` editor prop.

  Recently it was converted from a boolean to an object to support heading links within nested containers such as tables, layouts, and expands.
  e.g. `allowHeadingAnchorLinks { allowNestedHeaderLinks: true }`

  Enabling this opted into a new, revised UI/UX for the copy link button adjacent to a heading.

  Now that this feature has been adopted by Confluence and rolled out to 100% of customers, this change removes the code for the legacy UI/UX
  since we have no desire to ever use it again. This will reduce the bundle size slightly.
