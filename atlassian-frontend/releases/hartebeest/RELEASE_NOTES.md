### @atlaskit/breadcrumbs@11.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`3f80f8a2e4b`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/3f80f8a2e4b) - In this version we made breadcrumbs dramatically faster, lighter and easier to use ðŸ¤©

  - BreadcrumbsStateless has been merged into the default export
  - Performance improvements
  - Faster internal analytics

  **Migrating from BreadcrumbsStateless**

  When needing to control breadcrumbs you can 1:1 replace the component with the default export from breadcrumbs.

  ```diff
  -import { BreadcrumbsStateless } from '@atlaskit/breadcrumbs';
  +import Breadcrumbs from '@atlaskit/breadcrumbs';

  -<BreadcrumbsStateless isExpanded />
  +<Breadcrumbs isExpanded />
  ```

  When `isExpanded` is provided, the component will act controlled, otherwise uncontrolled.

  **Upgrading with the codemod**

  There exists a codemod to help you upgrade. Make sure to be on the latest version of breadcrumbs before running.

  ```
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/breadcrumbs@latest
  ```

  Then you can use our cli tool to run the codemod:

  ```
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
  ```

  And then follow the prompts to select the breadcrumbs codemod.

---

### @atlaskit/calendar@10.1.0

#### Minor Changes

- [`985961ce983`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/985961ce983) - Internal change from class to function components

  - We have converted all the components from class to functional. This improved performance quite a bit. Initial rendering, hydration, interaction, bundlesize and re-rendering; all have been improved.
  - We have made all the prop typings optional now. Earlier they were not aligned with the prop values (which were all optional earlier).
  - We have stopped exporting internal `CalendarClassType` and `ArrowKeys` types which were not compatible with functional components. Instead we have exported `CalendarInternalRef` type temporarily for backward compatibility and a new optional prop `internalRef` which consumers can use to access internal api's. Right now only `@atlaskit/datetime-picker` uses `navigate()` api for navigation which will be removed soon. This new type and prop are not recommended. So please don't use them.
  - We have also exported a new type `SelectEvent` along with already exported `ChangeEvent`, which consumers can use with `onSelect` and `onChange` prop.
  - We have also added `ref` support which points to the top level element. Earlier it was not officially supported.
  - Dev changes includes: folder restructuring and cleanup, lodash removal, memoizing components etc.

---

### @atlaskit/code@13.2.0

#### Minor Changes

- [`3c7be954dbd`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/3c7be954dbd) - [ux] Line highlighting now meets WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Colors that were failing contrast have been updated and there is now a new visual cue consisting of a left border to the highlighted lines.
- [`23ef692842a`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/23ef692842a) - [ux] `Code` and `CodeBlock` now use react-syntax-highlighter@^15 to highlight code. As part of this change
  the fontSize for the line numbers and the code body have been normalised. This will be a breaking visual change for all consumers.
  No action is required other than a callout that this will affect any existing visual regression tests.

  Users can now use the `themeOverride` prop to customise the application of the default theme. This is an escape hatch
  which will likley be removed in a future major version.

  This change also includes:

  - A bugfix for lineHeight that meant linenumbers and code body were not vertically aligned correctly.
  - A bugfix for the SSR'd components not rendering consistently before hydration
  - Improved semantic lines, which can now be properly consumed by screen readers.
  - The `Code` and `CodeBlock` now expose additional options in their `theme` prop. These are `codeFontSize` and `codeLineHeight`
    which allow customisation of the component's rendered font size.

- [`7c2f2056ef7`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/7c2f2056ef7) - [ux] Added code syntax highlighting for the following languages: AppleScript, Clojure, Delphi, Diff, FoxPro, Object Pascal, QML, Standard ML, Visual Basic, JSX and TSX

#### Patch Changes

- [`72d19d3f308`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/72d19d3f308) - Internal changes relating to types, and tests. Includes a small bugfix to the way Code component had styles applied and adds testId as a prop to both Code and CodeBlock.
- [`a4bcf21a972`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/a4bcf21a972) - [ux] Syntax highlighting now uses accessibile colors that meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA guidelines for color contrast
