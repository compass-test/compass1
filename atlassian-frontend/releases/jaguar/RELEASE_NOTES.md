### @atlaskit/adf-schema@14.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`85cc08ec2e6`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/85cc08ec2e6) - [ED-11353] Adds the input method for undo/redo events

  #Breaking Change

  `adf-schema`

  AnalyticsStep doesn't need the `handleAnalyticsEvent: HandleAnalyticsEvent<P>` anymore.
  We are submitting the events using the editor-core plugin `analytics`. On this file:
  `packages/editor/editor-core/src/plugins/analytics/plugin.ts`

  This will fix a hard to catch bug where the events were being dispatched before the transaction being applied.
  The transaction wasn't used, but the event was dispatched anyway, causing a data mismatch between user experience and actions.

#### Minor Changes

- [`be0bfb03f12`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/be0bfb03f12) - [ux] Implement syntax highlighting in editor code-block

#### Patch Changes

### @atlaskit/editor-core@139.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`511a91ad376`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/511a91ad376) - [ux] ED-12128: Update Context Panel to use set width of 320px and remove 'width' prop.
  Remove 'width' prop from the Context Panel component as we no longer allow dynamic panel width to enforce consistency.

  All references to this component can safely remove the 'wdith' prop as it is no longer part of the component props.

- [`007103b93e6`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/007103b93e6) - [ux] ED-11993 Change behaviour of context panel so it will not push content if there is enough space to slide out without overlapping.
  Config panel will keep existing behaviour to push content if there isn't enough space to show without overlapping content. Also add width css transition to context panel content to mimic "slide in" animation.

  Add new shared const of `akEditorFullWidthLayoutLineLength` which indicates the line length of a full-width editor

#### Minor Changes

  #Breaking Change

  `adf-schema`

  AnalyticsStep doesn't need the `handleAnalyticsEvent: HandleAnalyticsEvent<P>` anymore.
  We are submitting the events using the editor-core plugin `analytics`. On this file:
  `packages/editor/editor-core/src/plugins/analytics/plugin.ts`

  This will fix a hard to catch bug where the events were being dispatched before the transaction being applied.
  The transaction wasn't used, but the event was dispatched anyway, causing a data mismatch between user experience and actions.

#### Patch Changes

- [`79c23df6340`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/79c23df6340) - Use injected package name and version for analytics instead of version.json.
- [`42785088a12`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/42785088a12) - - Migrate old entry points to new one. Calendar now has only following exports:

  - **default export**. Can be imported like:
    - `import Calendar from '@atlaskit/calendar'`
  - **named type exports** (`CalendarProps`, `ChangeEvent`, `SelectEvent`).
    Can be imported like:
    - `import { CalendarProps, ChangeEvent, SelectEvent } from '@atlaskit/calendar'`
    - `import { CalendarProps, ChangeEvent, SelectEvent } from '@atlaskit/calendar/types'`.

  **Internal change**

  - Remove reference of private types and props from the documentation. Right now private type is `CalendarInternalRef` and private prop is `calendarRef`.
  - Rename calendar exported private ref type from `CalendarInternalRef` to `CalendarRef`.
  - Rename calendar private prop from `internalRef` to `calendarRef`.

- [`f74ba30c53c`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/f74ba30c53c) - **Internal change**

  - We have improved re-rendering quite a bit by memoizing components, loops and rendered elements.
  - Duplicate "pad-to-two" util has been removed.
  - Refactored few variables/functions/types.
  - Extracted out few components for readability purpose.

- Updated dependencies
