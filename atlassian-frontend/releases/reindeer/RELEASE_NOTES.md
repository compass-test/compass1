- [`f166f5398b2`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/f166f5398b2) - In this version we made **Blanket** faster and lighter

  - General performance improvements

  - **BREAKING** **Blanket** now accepts a `children` prop whose value is of type `ReactElement`.

  - **BREAKING** `canClickThrough` prop is now renamed to `shouldAllowClickThrough`.

  **Running the codemod cli**

  To run the codemod: **You first need to have the latest version installed**

  ```bash
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/blanket@^12.0.0
  ```

  Once upgraded,
  use `@atlaskit/codemod-cli`:

  ```bash
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli --parser babel --extensions ts,tsx,js [relativePath]
  ```

  The CLI will show a list of components and versions so select `@atlaskit/blanket@^12.0.0` and you will automatically be upgraded.

  What will be changed:

  - It will rename the `canClickThrough` prop to `shouldAllowClickThrough`.

  Run `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli -h` for more details on usage.

  For Atlassians,
  refer to the [documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/framework/atlassian-frontend/codemods/01-atlassian-codemods/) for more details on the codemod CLI.

### @atlaskit/calendar@12.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`4ab5a7e9069`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/4ab5a7e9069) - #### Major:

  Removes `defaultDisabled` prop, a stateless/uncontrolled variant of the `disabled` prop. As a stateless calendar would never change its disabled dates, this prop was unnecessary.

  #### New Features:

  Adds three props to make disabling dates more practical, performant and expressive in `@atlaskit/calendar`. These features are also available for DatePicker:

  - `minDate` for the minimum valid date
  - `maxDate` for the maximum valid date
  - `disabledDateFilter`, a function that takes a date string, and returns whether or not it should be disabled.

  #### Bugs

  - Disabled dates that lie outside of the currently selected month now have correct hover styles

#### Patch Changes

### @atlaskit/avatar-group@8.3.0

#### Minor Changes

- [`5ba523fc937`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/5ba523fc937) - Now the `AvatarGroup` is marked with ul and li elements. This makes it easier for users with assistive technologies to distinguish `AvatarGroup` ( which is a list of avatars ) among other page components. The default label that the screen reader announces when a user selects the AvatarGroup is `list avatar group x items`. When one of AvatarGroupItems is selected screen reader announcement is `[avatar label], i of n` where `i` - index of a selected item, `n` - the length of the list.

  To change the label of a list you can use `label` props.
