  ```js
  // Before

  import { AnnotationType } from '@atlaskit/adf-schema';

  annotation({
    type: AnnotationType,
  });

  // After

  import { AnnotationTypes } from '@atlaskit/adf-schema';

  annotation({
    type: AnnotationTypes.INLINE_COMMENT,
  });
  ```

#### Minor Changes

- [`39b2e48c32`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/39b2e48c32) - Export new Add Column custom step in `@atlaskit/adf-schema/steps`
- [`50c333ab3a`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/50c333ab3a) - EDM-216: Adds EmbedCards in the Editor under the flag - allowEmbeds in the UNSAFE_cards prop

#### Patch Changes

- [`0964848b95`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/0964848b95) - [FM-3505] Add support for inline comments in the renderer mobile bridge getElementScrollOffsetByNodeType function
- [`54d82b49f0`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/54d82b49f0) - Remove unused dependencies

---

### @atlaskit/avatar@18.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`b1fa2d6d1c`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/b1fa2d6d1c) - Avatar has been refactored to improve performance and be compliant with the lite-mode specification.
  Since there are significant prop and API changes, we will be providing a codemod to help consumers upgrade their components.

  To run the codemod:

  **You first need to have the latest avatar installed before you can run the codemod**

  `yarn upgrade @atlaskit/avatar@^18.0.0`

  **Run the codemod cli**

  `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory`

  For more information on @atlaskit/codemod-cli please refer to [this doc](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/docs/guides/atlassian-codemods)

  ### Summary

  - Fixes re-rendering issues
  - Removes all deprecated theme API. This includes previous experimental dark-mode theme support
  - Stop accepting and spreading arbitrary props
  - Removes analytics-next HOCs in favor of hook variant (You may need to update snapshot tests)
  - Removes all usage of HOCs
  - Replaces `styled-components` v3 with `@emotion/core` to improve runtime and bundlesize

  #### Avatar API / PROP CHANGES

  - `enableTooltip` removed. Please use `@atlaskit/tooltip` instead
  - `onClick` method signature has been simplified to `onChange(event, analyticsEvent)`
  - `isHover` removed
  - `isActive` removed
  - `isFocus` removed
  - `isSelected` removed
  - `theme` removed
  - Added prop types to the `component` prop
  - `BORDER_WIDTH` is now a single value rather than an object
  - `withPseudoState`, `getProps`, `getBorderRadius`, `getInnerStyles` have been removed and are therefor no longer available. These methods were for designed for internal use and use within the AvatarGroup component.

  ### Avatar Item API / PROP CHANGES

  - `enableTruncation` renamed to `isTruncationDisabled`
  - `onClick` method signature has been simplified to `onChange(event, analyticsEvent)`
  - `isHover` removed
  - `isActive` removed
  - `isFocus` removed
  - `isSelected` removed
  - `theme` removed
  - Added prop types to the `component` prop

---

### @atlaskit/avatar-group@6.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`a7ca7039c7`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/a7ca7039c7) - AvatarGroup previously depended heavily on Avatar internals such as styles, `getProps` and `withPseudoState`. These have been moved directly into AvatarGroup to finally decouple the two components. We will revisit this when we convert AvatarGroup to lite-mode and most likely remove them entirely.

  Previously, it was possible to pass arbritray props to the underlying Avatar via the `data` prop. This is no longer supported. Please pass props directly to the custom avatar / presence / status components.

#### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

---

### @atlaskit/editor-core@124.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`1543651ede`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/1543651ede) - ED-9174: Take control of context panel when plugins need and add smooth enter/leave transition

  Products were trying to solve transition issues on their side and it was causing issues when plugins tried to open the context panel.
  This change will override any limitation we had before, taking control of the panel independent of existing panels.

  The breaking change here is that <ContextPanel> now needs a single child so having text nodes or a collection of nodes directly inside won't work. The simplest solution is to wrap the content on a <div> if required. There is nothing to change if you were passing a single node already.

- [`68baa7f1a5`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/68baa7f1a5) - ED-9246 Remove `pollingInterval` from annotation provider. Add meta for `replaceDocument` actions.

  This change removes the `pollingInterval` property from the `annotationProvider` editor prop. This changes as the annotation provider no longer uses an internal timer, but rather subscribes and listens to a provided `AnnotationEventEmitter`.

  #### Before

  ```
  <Editor
    annotationProviders={{
      inlineComment: {
        pollingInterval: 1000, // <==== This property is being removed
        createComponent: ExampleCreateInlineCommentComponent,
        viewComponent: ExampleViewInlineCommentComponent,
        getState: this.inlineCommentGetState,
      },
    }}
  />
  ```

  #### After

  ```
  <Editor
    annotationProviders={{
      inlineComment: {
        createComponent: ExampleCreateInlineCommentComponent,
        viewComponent: ExampleViewInlineCommentComponent,
        getState: this.inlineCommentGetState,
      },
    }}
  />
  ```

- [`d31f2fd85b`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/d31f2fd85b) - ED-8917 Update annotation provider to sync updates with an EventEmitter

  As part of the inflight work of building annotations within the editor, the annotation provider API is being updated to be event based. This is part of the work to make the annotation provider no longer rely on a timer, rather make it rely on pushed updates from the consumer.

  This change also includes

  - Renaming of the Editor Prop `AnnotationProvider` to `AnnotationProviders` (plural).
  - Coupling the UI component with the relevant annotation provider
  - Adding the `updateSubscriber` attribute

  #### Before

  ```
  <Editor
    annotationProvider: {
      createComponent: ExampleCreateInlineCommentComponent,
      viewComponent: ExampleViewInlineCommentComponent,
      providers: {
        inlineComment: {
        getState: getCommentState,
      },
    }
  >
  ```

  #### After

  ```
  <Editor
    annotationProviders: {
      inlineComment: {
        createComponent: ExampleCreateInlineCommentComponent,
        viewComponent: ExampleViewInlineCommentComponent,
        getState: getCommentState,
        updateSubscriber: updateEmitter
      },
    }
  >
  ```

  Where `updateEmitter` is an instance of `AnnotationUpdateEmitter` imported from `@atlaskit/editor-core`. It's a strongly typed `EventEmitter` that should only fire with `resolve` and `unresolve`, passing a single `annotationId`.

  ```
  import {AnnotationUpdateEmitter} from '@atlaskit/editor-core';

  const updateEmitter = new AnnotationUpdateEmitter();
  updateEmitter.emit('resolve', myAnnotationId);
  ```

#### Minor Changes

- [`76160b5c71`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/76160b5c71) - [FM-2506] added cursor selection location plugin
- [`fd90289419`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/fd90289419) - ED-8981 Make decision items selectable
- [`6706fd9eaa`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/6706fd9eaa) - ED-9076: Add participants count to performance related analytics events

### @atlaskit/range@4.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`da1c8c16d4`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/da1c8c16d4) - In this version we made range dramatically faster and lighter 🤩

  #### Changes

  In `4.0.0` we bring significant performance improvements all for just the cost of 1 breaking change 😮. That's not all folks because this update comes with a 🤑 FREE 🤑 codemod for you to upgrade with.

  - Range no longer has a `peerDependency` on `styled-components@3`. Internally range is now using `@emotion/core` for styling
  - A performance issue made the range noticeably laggy with large ranges. With this change we are no longer creating new classes on each step change and instead updating a css variable, making Range noticeably smoother.
  - Changed the `inputRef` prop to be `ref` which returns the `ref` of the range input using `React.forwardRef`. This new `ref` prop will accept the type of the old `inputRef` prop, `(input?: HTMLInputElement) => any`, as well as if `ref` is created with `React.createRef`.
  - A new example that shows off how to rate limit your `onChange` event

  #### Automatic upgrading

  ```
  ## You first need to have the latest range installed before you can run the codemod
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/range@^4.0.0

  ## Run the codemod cli
  ## Pass in a parser for your codebase
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
  ```

  ##### Notes

  - You first need to upgrade to `4.0.0` **before** you run the codemod cli. This is because the cli will look in your local `node_modules` for the codemod which is published inside the `spinner` package.
  - The codemod is pretty clever, and will respect aliasing as well as using custom naming for the default import

  ##### Ez pz lemon squeezy

  The codemod will change the `inputRef` prop to `ref`

  ```diff
  - <Range inputRef={inputRef} />
  + <Range ref={inputRef} />

  - <Range
  -   inputRef={ref => {
  -     myRangeRef = ref;
  -   }}
  - />
  + <Range
  +   ref={ref => {
  +     myRangeRef = ref;
  +   }}
  + />

  ```

### @atlaskit/spinner@13.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`206be3a0cb`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/206be3a0cb) - In this version we made spinner dramatically faster and lighter 🤩

  #### Fix: Mounting animation

  The mounting animation for spinner has been fixed. There are three parts to the mounting spinner animation:

  1. Accelerated spin
  2. Fade in
  3. Stretch (the spinner starts small and grows to a bigger size)

  In `12.x` the fade in and stretch parts of the animation were broken 😢. These have been fixed in `13.0.0` 🤘

  #### Changes

  _See below for information about a codemod we created to automatically upgrade usages of spinner ❤️_

  There have been a number of breaking changes in `13.0.0`.

  - Spinner no longer has a `peerDependency` on `styled-components@3`. Internally spinner is now using `@emotion/core` for styling
  - Added new `ref` prop which returns the `ref` of the spinner `svg` using `React.forwardRef`
  - Improved dark mode support (not that dark mode is truly supported yet). `appearance="invert"` will now invert the colors of the spinner in dark mode. Previously `appearance="invert"` in dark mode did nothing.
  - The default `delay` prop value has been reduced from `100ms` to `0ms`. The delay was previously designed to prevent the spinner from flickering if async content becomes quickly visible. Now that the fade in animation is working correctly, the spinner is only 2% visible at 100ms.
  - The `delay` prop is no longer useful to prevent "quick flickering" so the default has been changed. We have created a guide to assist you with better understanding how to use delays, as well as provided new guidance on how to cross fade a spinner with other loading content.
  - The `invertColor={boolean}` prop has been renamed to `appearance="inherit | invert"` to bring it into line with other components. This is useful when you are displaying a spinner on a background that is not the same background color scheme as the body.
  - Changing name of the `SpinnerSizes` type to `Size`. Most people are not using this type directly
  - `isCompleting` and `onComplete` props have been removed. Spinner no longer manages it's own unmount animations. If you want to have graceful unmounting we now have a recommended pattern which leverages our general purpose and performant `@atlaskit/motion` package. (Note: spinner will always animate itself in, you don't need to set anything up).

  #### Automatic upgrading

  ```
  ## You first need to have the latest spinner installed before you can run the codemod
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/spinner@^13.0.0

  ## Run the codemod cli
  ## Pass in a parser for your codebase
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
  ```

  ##### Notes

  - You first need to upgrade to `13.0.0` **before** you run the codemod cli. This is because the cli will look in your local `node_modules` for the codemod which is published inside the `spinner` package.
  - The codemod is pretty clever, and will respect aliasing as well as using custom naming for the default import 🤘

  ##### Feel the power

  What the codemod will do:

  - `delay`: replace literal number values equal to or less than 150ms as they are no longer needed to avoid flickering

  ```diff
  - <Spinner delay={0} />
  + <Spinner />

  - <Spinner delay={100} />
  + <Spinner />

  - <Spinner delay={150} />
  + <Spinner />

  // no change
  <Spinner delay={151} />
  <Spinner delay={myValue} />
  ```

  - `invertColor`: automatically changed over to `appearance="inherit | invert"`. All existing logic will be preserved in your code

  ```diff
  - <Spinner invertColor />
  + <Spinner appearance="invert" />

  - <Spinner invertColor={false} />
  + <Spinner />

  - <Spinner invertColor={true} />
  + <Spinner appearance="invert" />

  - <Spinner invertColor={expression} />
  + <Spinner appearance={expression ? "invert" : "inherit"} />
  ```

  - `isCompleting` and `onComplete`: removing props. But it will not remove the state or functions associated with those props. If you where using those props there will be manual intervention required. We cannot reasonably trace back and remove these values as they could be used for other purposes.

  _NOTE: values associated with isCompleting and onComplete props are not removed, just the props on the Spinner component_

  ```diff
  function App() {
    const [isCompleting] = useState(false);
    const onComplete = () => {};
  - return (
  -   <Spinner
  -     isCompleting={isCompleting}
  -     onComplete={() => {
  -       console.log('on complete!');
  -       onComplete();
  -     }}
  -     delay={1000}
  -   />
  - );
  + return <Spinner delay={1000} />;
  }
  ```

  - `SpinnerSizes` type: automatically shifted over to a new name: `Size`
