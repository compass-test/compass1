### @atlaskit/adf-schema@10.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`0ae829a4ea`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/0ae829a4ea) - EDM-648: Adds resizing and alignment to embed cards

#### Patch Changes

- [`fb1a9c8009`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/fb1a9c8009) - [FM-3726] Call onAnnotationClick when user taps in inline comment on Renderer

### @atlaskit/avatar@18.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`b1fa2d6d1c`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/b1fa2d6d1c) - Avatar has been refactored to improve performance and be compliant with the lite-mode specification.
  Since there are significant prop and API changes, we will be providing a codemod to help consumers upgrade their components.

  To run the codemod:

  **You first need to have the latest avatar installed before you can run the codemod**

  `yarn upgrade @atlaskit/avatar@^18.0.0`

  **Run the codemod cli**

  `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory`

  For more information on @atlaskit/codemod-cli please refer to [this doc](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/docs/guides/atlassian-codemods)

  ### Summary

  - Fixes re-rendering issues
  - Removes all deprecated theme API. This includes previous experimental dark-mode theme support
  - Stop accepting and spreading arbitrary props
  - Removes analytics-next HOCs in favor of hook variant (You may need to update snapshot tests)
  - Removes all usage of HOCs
  - Replaces `styled-components` v3 with `@emotion/core` to improve runtime and bundlesize

  #### Avatar API / PROP CHANGES

  - `enableTooltip` removed. Please use `@atlaskit/tooltip` instead
  - `onClick` method signature has been simplified to `onChange(event, analyticsEvent)`
  - `isHover` removed
  - `isActive` removed
  - `isFocus` removed
  - `isSelected` removed
  - `theme` removed
  - Added prop types to the `component` prop
  - `BORDER_WIDTH` is now a single value rather than an object
  - `withPseudoState`, `getProps`, `getBorderRadius`, `getInnerStyles` have been removed and are therefor no longer available. These methods were for designed for internal use and use within the AvatarGroup component.

  ### Avatar Item API / PROP CHANGES

  - `enableTruncation` renamed to `isTruncationDisabled`
  - `onClick` method signature has been simplified to `onChange(event, analyticsEvent)`
  - `isHover` removed
  - `isActive` removed
  - `isFocus` removed
  - `isSelected` removed
  - `theme` removed
  - Added prop types to the `component` prop

#### Patch Changes

- [`1c401b41d6`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/1c401b41d6) - Codemod updated to target the correct avatarItem prop name
- [`e3cb6026bc`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/e3cb6026bc) - Updates the v18 codemod to ensure it doesnt format files that are not relevant

---

### @atlaskit/avatar-group@6.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`a7ca7039c7`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/a7ca7039c7) - AvatarGroup previously depended heavily on Avatar internals such as styles, `getProps` and `withPseudoState`. These have been moved directly into AvatarGroup to finally decouple the two components. We will revisit this when we convert AvatarGroup to lite-mode and most likely remove them entirely.

  Previously, it was possible to pass arbritray props to the underlying Avatar via the `data` prop. This is no longer supported. Please pass props directly to the custom avatar / presence / status components.

#### Patch Changes

- [`e91d934e94`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/e91d934e94) - Using avatar.name + index as key for AvatarGroup
- Updated dependencies

### @atlaskit/spinner@13.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`206be3a0cb`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/206be3a0cb) - In this version we made spinner dramatically faster and lighter 🤩

  #### Fix: Mounting animation

  The mounting animation for spinner has been fixed. There are three parts to the mounting spinner animation:

  1. Accelerated spin
  2. Fade in
  3. Stretch (the spinner starts small and grows to a bigger size)

  In `12.x` the fade in and stretch parts of the animation were broken 😢. These have been fixed in `13.0.0` 🤘

  #### Changes

  _See below for information about a codemod we created to automatically upgrade usages of spinner ❤️_

  There have been a number of breaking changes in `13.0.0`.

  - Spinner no longer has a `peerDependency` on `styled-components@3`. Internally spinner is now using `@emotion/core` for styling
  - Added new `ref` prop which returns the `ref` of the spinner `svg` using `React.forwardRef`
  - Improved dark mode support (not that dark mode is truly supported yet). `appearance="invert"` will now invert the colors of the spinner in dark mode. Previously `appearance="invert"` in dark mode did nothing.
  - The default `delay` prop value has been reduced from `100ms` to `0ms`. The delay was previously designed to prevent the spinner from flickering if async content becomes quickly visible. Now that the fade in animation is working correctly, the spinner is only 2% visible at 100ms.
  - The `delay` prop is no longer useful to prevent "quick flickering" so the default has been changed. We have created a guide to assist you with better understanding how to use delays, as well as provided new guidance on how to cross fade a spinner with other loading content.
  - The `invertColor={boolean}` prop has been renamed to `appearance="inherit | invert"` to bring it into line with other components. This is useful when you are displaying a spinner on a background that is not the same background color scheme as the body.
  - Changing name of the `SpinnerSizes` type to `Size`. Most people are not using this type directly
  - `isCompleting` and `onComplete` props have been removed. Spinner no longer manages it's own unmount animations. If you want to have graceful unmounting we now have a recommended pattern which leverages our general purpose and performant `@atlaskit/motion` package. (Note: spinner will always animate itself in, you don't need to set anything up).

  #### Automatic upgrading

  ```
  ## You first need to have the latest spinner installed before you can run the codemod
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/spinner@^13.0.0

  ## Run the codemod cli
  ## Pass in a parser for your codebase
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
  ```

  ##### Notes

  - You first need to upgrade to `13.0.0` **before** you run the codemod cli. This is because the cli will look in your local `node_modules` for the codemod which is published inside the `spinner` package.
  - The codemod is pretty clever, and will respect aliasing as well as using custom naming for the default import 🤘

  ##### Feel the power

  What the codemod will do:

  - `delay`: replace literal number values equal to or less than 150ms as they are no longer needed to avoid flickering

  ```diff
  - <Spinner delay={0} />
  + <Spinner />

  - <Spinner delay={100} />
  + <Spinner />

  - <Spinner delay={150} />
  + <Spinner />

  // no change
  <Spinner delay={151} />
  <Spinner delay={myValue} />
  ```

  - `invertColor`: automatically changed over to `appearance="inherit | invert"`. All existing logic will be preserved in your code

  ```diff
  - <Spinner invertColor />
  + <Spinner appearance="invert" />

  - <Spinner invertColor={false} />
  + <Spinner />

  - <Spinner invertColor={true} />
  + <Spinner appearance="invert" />

  - <Spinner invertColor={expression} />
  + <Spinner appearance={expression ? "invert" : "inherit"} />
  ```

  - `isCompleting` and `onComplete`: removing props. But _it will not remove the state or functions associated with those props_. We cannot automatically remove the values or control flow associated with these props. **If you were using `isCompleting` or `onComplete` props there will be manual intervention required**.

  ```diff
  function App() {
    const [isCompleting] = useState(false);
    const onComplete = () => {};
  - return (
  -   <Spinner
  -     isCompleting={isCompleting}
  -     onComplete={() => {
  -       console.log('on complete!');
  -       onComplete();
  -     }}
  -     delay={1000}
  -   />
  - );
  + return <Spinner delay={1000} />;
  }
  ```

  If you were using `onComplete` for control flow, we now recommend using the performant and standard `@atlaskit/motion` solution

  ```js
  import React, { useState } from 'react';
  import Spinner from '@atlaskit/spinner';
  import appLoaded from './control-flow';

  function App() {
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
    // faking the end of a loading event
    useEffect(() => {
      const id = setTimeout(() => setIsLoading(false), 1000);
      return () => clearTimeout(id);
    }, []);
    return <Spinner isCompleting={!isLoading} onComplete={appLoaded} />;
  }
  ```

  ```js
  import React, {useState} from 'react';
  import Spinner from '@atlaskit/spinner';
  import { ExitingPersistence, FadeIn } from '@atlaskit/motion';
  import appLoaded from './control-flow';

  function App() {
     const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

    // faking the end of a loading event
    useEffect(() => {
      const id = setTimeout(() => setIsLoading(false), 1000);
      return () => clearTimeout(id);
    }, []);

    const onFinish = useCallback((state) => {
      if(state === 'exiting') {
        appLoaded();
      }
    }, []);

    return (
      <ExitingPersistence>
        {isLoading && (
          <FadeIn onFinish={onFinish}>
            {props => (
              <span {...props}>
                <Spinner size="xlarge" />
              </span>
            )}
          </FadeIn>
        )}
      <ExitingPersistence>
    );
  }
  ```

  - `SpinnerSizes` type: automatically shifted over to a new name: `Size`
