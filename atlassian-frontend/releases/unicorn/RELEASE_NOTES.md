### @atlaskit/editor-core@148.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`71bb1bb3cd0`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/71bb1bb3cd0) - [ED-12933] Replace TypeAhead node mark to ProseMirror Decoration

  ## Minor change

  Type Ahead isn't a part of the document anymore. This version is introducing
  the Decoration system for this internal API.

  ## Breaking Change

  We are replacing those public API:

  ```
  export { selectItem } from './plugins/type-ahead/commands/select-item';
  export { insertTypeAheadQuery } from './plugins/type-ahead/commands/insert-query';
  export { dismissCommand } from './plugins/type-ahead/commands/dismiss';
  export { insertMentionQuery } from './plugins/mentions/commands/insert-mention-query';
  export { insertEmojiQuery } from './plugins/emoji/commands/insert-emoji-query';
  ```

  If you need those behavior, please use this new one:

  ```
  export { createTypeAheadTools } from './plugins/type-ahead/api';
  export { createQuickInsertTools } from './plugins/quick-insert/api';
  ```

  Before:

  ```
  import {
    insertTypeAheadQuery,
    insertMentionQuery,
    dismissCommand,
  } from '@atlaskit/editor-core';

  // open the typeahead menu for mention
  insertMentionQuery(editorView.state, editorView.dispatch);

  // insert item
  insertTypeAheadQuery(editorView.state, editorView.dispatch);

  // close type ahead menu
  insertTypeAheadQuery(editorView.state, editorView.dispatch);
  ```

  Now:

  ```

  import {
    createTypeAheadTools,
  } from '@atlaskit/editor-core';

  const tools = createTypeAheadTools(editorView);

  tools.openMention();
  tools.insertMention();
  tools.close();
  ```

### @atlaskit/editor-mobile-bridge@29.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`c79e5921417`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/c79e5921417) - ME-1521: introduced a method to invoke async functions and submit a cross platfrom promise on completion. Made the scrollToNode method itself async to prevent some rare race conditions if other bridge methods where invoked before completion.

#### Minor Changes

- [`ed9720f8046`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/ed9720f8046) - CETI-48: Added renderer configurations to support custom panels
- [`ebcba6baa2a`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/ebcba6baa2a) - Added API for getting the stepVersion from collab provider and passing it via the mobile bridge
- [`71bb1bb3cd0`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/71bb1bb3cd0) - [ED-12933] Replace TypeAhead internal tools for tools function

  ## Why

  Before mobile bridge was using internal editor logic. That would make our life harder
  to add feature flags, bug fixing or code refactoring.

#### Patch Changes

- [`2f5b81920af`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/2f5b81920af) - Refactor the provider class in collab provider
- [`4f4769d0176`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/4f4769d0176) - Updated unit tests (unmocked helper function)
- [`363971afa29`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/363971afa29) - [ux] [ED-13574] Resolving a regression in the quick insert in mobile.

### @atlaskit/modal-dialog@12.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`07ad26948a1`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/07ad26948a1) - In this version we made modal dialog dramatically faster and lighter with a new composable API.
  This is a large change and we have provided a codemod to help you upgrade.
  Once you have run the codemod there may be manual change required so read below for all the changes in
  this release.

  **Running the codemod cli**

  To run the codemod: **You first need to have the latest version installed**

  ```bash
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/modal-dialog@^12.0.0
  ```

  Once upgraded, use `@atlaskit/codemod-cli`:

  ```bash
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli --parser {tsx|babylon} --extensions ts,tsx,js [relativePath]
  ```

  The CLI will show a list of components and versions so select `@atlaskit/modal-dialog@^12.0.0` and you will automatically be upgraded.
  If your usage of `@atlaskit/modal-dialog` cannot be upgraded a comment will be left that a manual change is required.

  Run `npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli -h` for more details on usage.
  For Atlassians,
  refer to the [documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/framework/atlassian-frontend/codemods/01-atlassian-codemods/) for more details on the codemod CLI.

  #### Visual changes

  The primary button in the footer is now on the right. This has changed from being on the left
  to match the [design documentation](https://atlassian.design/components/modal-dialog/usage).

  The codemod will automatically reverse the order of your actions for this to happen.
  You could previously achieve this behaviour by adding an `appearance` key to your actions. The
  codemod will detect this and not reverse the array in this case.

  #### Composable API

  The old version of modal dialog had three props that mapped into components.

  - `heading` was the text for the header.
  - `children` was the React node that ended up in the modal body.
  - `actions` was an array of objects that mapped into buttons in the footer.

  The new composable API exposes these components so that you can use them directly as
  a child of modal dialog. This creates a clear parallel between what is given as children and what
  the modal dialog renders. It also allows you to use any valid React node as a child of modal
  dialog.

  ```
  // Before
  import Modal, { ModalTransition } from '@atlaskit/modal-dialog';

  ...

  <ModalTransition>
    {isOpen && (
      <Modal
        onClose={close}
        heading="Modal Title"
        actions={[
          { text: 'Secondary Action', onClick: secondaryAction },
          { text: 'Close', onClick: close },
        ]}
      >
        <Lorem count={2} />
      </Modal>
    )}
  </ModalTransition>

  // After
  import Modal, {
    ModalBody,
    ModalFooter,
    ModalHeader,
    ModalTitle,
    ModalTransition,
  } from '@atlaskit/modal-dialog';
  import Button from '@atlaskit/button/standard-button';

  ...

  <ModalTransition>
    {isOpen && (
      <Modal onClose={close}>
        <ModalHeader>
          <ModalTitle>Modal Title</ModalTitle>
        </ModalHeader>
        <ModalBody>
          <Lorem count={2} />
        </ModalBody>
        <ModalFooter>
          <Button appearance="subtle" onClick={secondaryAction}>
            Secondary Action
          </Button>
          <Button appearance="primary" autoFocus onClick={close}>
            Close
          </Button>
        </ModalFooter>
      </Modal>
    )}
  </ModalTransition>
  ```

  ##### Children

  The original children need to be wrapped in a `ModalBody`.

  ```
  // Before
  <Modal>
    <Lorem count={2} />
  </Modal>

  // After
  <Modal>
    <ModalBody>
      <Lorem count={2} />
    </ModalBody>
  </Modal>
  ```

  ##### Heading

  The `heading` prop turns into a `ModalHeader` and `ModalTitle`.

  ```
  // Before
  <Modal heading="Modal Title">
    <Lorem count={2} />
  </Modal>

  // After
  <Modal>
    <ModalHeader>
      <ModalTitle>Modal Title</ModalTitle>
    </ModalHeader>
    <ModalBody>
      <Lorem count={2} />
    </ModalBody>
  </Modal>
  ```

  ##### Actions

  The `actions` prop turns into `Button`'s in a `ModalFooter`.

  ```
  // Before
  <Modal
    actions={[
      { text: 'Secondary Action', onClick: secondaryAction },
      { text: 'Close', onClick: close },
    ]}
    heading="Modal Title"
  >
    <Lorem count={2} />
  </Modal>

  // After
  <Modal>
    <ModalHeader>
      <ModalTitle>Modal Title</ModalTitle>
    </ModalHeader>
    <ModalBody>
      <Lorem count={2} />
    </ModalBody>
    <ModalFooter>
      <Button appearance="subtle" onClick={secondaryAction}>
        Secondary Action
      </Button>
      <Button appearance="primary" autoFocus onClick={close}>
        Close
      </Button>
    </ModalFooter>
  </Modal>
  ```

  Previously in the examples the primary button was on the left, we’ve updated the
  documentation to match our design documentation so that the primary button is on the right.
  You could previously achieve this behaviour by adding an `appearance` key to your actions.
  The codemod will reverse the order of your actions if you have not set the `appearance` in the actions.

  #### Components prop

  The `components` prop has been entirely replaced with the composable API.
  The philosophy of creating a custom component that receive modal's props has been replaced with
  custom components where the user can define their own props.

  ##### Container

  To replace using the `Container` prop you can wrap `Modal`'s children in the container component.
  Note that unless you are using a `form` you will need to add the style `all: inherit;` to ensure scrolling
  works.

  ```
  // Before
  <Modal
    components={{
      Container: (props) => (
        <form {...props} onSubmit={onSubmit}>
          {props.children}
        </form>
      ),
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </Modal>

  // After
  <Modal>
    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      {children}
    </form>
  </Modal>
  ```

  ##### Header

  To replace using the `Header` prop you can use your custom header as the first child.

  ```
  // Before
  <Modal
    components={{
      Header: CustomHeader,
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </Modal>

  // After
  <Modal>
    <CustomHeader />
    {children}
  </Modal>
  ```

  If you are creating a custom header you should call the new hook `useModal` to get the
  title id so the content and the title can be linked. You can also access the `onClose`
  function this way.

  ```
  import { useModal } from '@atlaskit/modal-dialog';

  const CustomHeader = () => {
    const { onClose, titleId } = useModal();
    return (
      <div css={headerStyles}>
        <h1 css={headingStyles} id={titleId}>
          Custom modal header
        </h1>
        <Button onClick={onClose}>
          Close
        </Button>
      </div>
    );
  };
  ```

  If you are doing something simple like adding a button you can continue to use `ModalHeader`.

  ```
  <ModalHeader>
    <ModalTitle>Custom modal header</ModalTitle>
    <Button appearance="link" onClick={closeModal}>
      Close
    </Button>
  </ModalHeader>
  ```

  ##### Footer and body

  Similar to `Header`, if you were using the `Footer` or `Body` prop,
  you can replace `ModalFooter` and `ModalBody` with any valid React node.
  `ModalFooter` and `ModalBody` also accept any valid React node as children.
  `useModal` works in any of `Modal`'s children if you wish to use it.

  #### Scroll behaviour

  The `scrollBehavior` prop has changed from strings 'inside', 'inside-wide' and 'outside'
  to a boolean `shouldScrollInViewport`. 'inside' and 'inside-wide' have consolidated to
  be `shouldScrollInViewport={false}` and 'outside' is `shouldScrollInViewport={true}`.

  #### Appearance

  The `appearance` prop has been removed from `Modal` and is now set on `ModalTitle` and
  the primary `Button`.

  ```
  // Before
  <ModalTransition>
    {isOpen && (
      <Modal
        appearance="danger"
        onClose={close}
        heading="Modal Title"
        actions={[
          { text: 'Secondary Action', onClick: secondaryAction },
          { text: 'Close', onClick: close },
        ]}
      >
        <Lorem count={2} />
      </Modal>
    )}
  </ModalTransition>

  // After
  <ModalTransition>
    {isOpen && (
      <Modal onClose={close}>
        <ModalHeader>
          <ModalTitle appearance="danger">Modal Title</ModalTitle>
        </ModalHeader>
        <ModalBody>
          <Lorem count={2} />
        </ModalBody>
        <ModalFooter>
          <Button appearance="subtle" onClick={secondaryAction}>
            Secondary Action
          </Button>
          <Button appearance="danger" autoFocus onClick={close}>
            Close
          </Button>
        </ModalFooter>
      </Modal>
    )}
  </ModalTransition>;
  ```

  #### isChromeless

  The `isChromeless` is no longer supported as you can any valid React node in `Modal`
  and choose not to use `ModalHeader`, `ModalBody` and `ModalFooter`. The only change to
  this behaviour is that there is no way to turn off the box shadow and border radius,
  which used to happen when `isChromeless={true}`. You only need to change your usage if
  `Modal`'s children set their own background and don’t have a border radius of 3 px.
  In this case set the border radius to 3px.

  #### Test IDs

  The mapping for test IDs have changed.

  Modal: `{testId}` -> `{testId}`

  Modal content: `{testId}-dialog-content` -> DOM node removed

  Modal header: `{testId}-dialog-content--header` -> `{testId}--header`

  Modal title: `{testId}-dialog-content--heading` -> `{testId}--title`

  Modal body: `{testId}-dialog-content--body` -> `{testId}--body`

  Modal footer: `{testId}-dialog-content--footer` -> `{testId}--footer`

  Scrollable body content: `{testId}-dialog-content--scrollable` -> `{testId}--scrollable`

  Blanket: `{testId}--blanket` -> `{testId}--blanket`

  Modal actions: `{testId}-dialog-content--action-{index}` -> Removed, can set on Button

  #### Miscallaneous changes

  - `ModalFooter` now uses `flex-end` instead of `space-between` to justify its contents.
  - Inner components `ModalFooter`, `ModalHeader` and `ModalBody` no longer accepts style prop.
    If you wish to modify the styles, you have to build your own component.
  - `ContainerComponentProps` and `ScrollBehavior` types are now removed with no replacements.
  - `(Header|Body|Footer|Title)ComponentProps` types are now aliased to
    `Modal(Header|Body|Footer|Title)Props`, however most props are not used anymore as state is
    shared via the `useModal` hook.

#### Patch Changes

- [`1efbaebfbf3`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/1efbaebfbf3) - Fixes a bug in the appearance of the modal focus state which is now consistent with other elements in the Design System.
