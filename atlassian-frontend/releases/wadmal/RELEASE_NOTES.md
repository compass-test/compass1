## Details

---

### @atlaskit/color-picker@1.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`d916beb818`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/d916beb818) - Upgraded Popper JS to version 2.2.3, which comes with bug fixes, performance improvements and a reduced bundle size when combined with @popperjs/core. This effects the values accepted by the `popperProps` prop.

  Changes labelled with ⚙️ have codemod support:

  - ⚙️ the `positionFixed` prop has been replaced with `strategy`, which takes either `"fixed"` or `"absolute"`
  - the `modifiers` prop has been significantly updated:
    - The format is now an array of objects, each labelled via a `name` key:value pair. Previously the prop
      was an object where each property was the modifier name.
    - Prop options are grouped together in an `options` object
    - default boundary paddings have been removed from `preventOverflow` and `flip`; to restore original
      padding, set `padding: 5`
    - modifiers that supported a `boundariesElement` option now have two options in its place:
      - `boundary`, which takes `clippingParents` (similar to `scrollParent`)
      - `rootBoundary` which takes `viewport` or `document` (replacing `viewport` and `window`respectively)
    - Each modifier has more internal changes not listed here: see [the Popper JS docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/) for more information

### @atlaskit/editor-core@128.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`68ca47f536`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/68ca47f536) - ED-9145: Remove analyticsHandler prop.

  We have removed the prop `analyticsHandler` from the `Editor` component, as these events are no longer tracked.

  e.g.

  ```
   <Editor
    analyticsHandler={fn}
   />
  ```

  You can safely remove this prop.

### @atlaskit/popper@5.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`044869b067`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/044869b067) - This major release of Popper upgrades from react-popper v.1.3.6 to 2.2.3, which includes version 2 of Popper JS (@popperjs/core). This is a complete re-write of popper.js which comes with bundle-size and performance improvements, as well as a number of bug fixes and longer-term support.

  There are a number of major changes for consumers are listed below; ⚙️ indicates the change has codemod support:

  - **Component Props**:
    - ⚙️ `offset` is no longer a string, but an array of two integers (i.e. '0px 8px' is now [0, 8])
  - **Render Props**:
    - ⚙️ `outOfBoundaries` has been replaced with `isReferenceHidden`, and is now true when the popper is hidden (i.e. by a
      scroll container)
    - ⚙️ `scheduleUpdate`, for async updates, has been renamed to `update`, and now returns a Promise.
    - **✨new** `hasPopperEscaped` tracks when the reference element is fully clipped or hidden
    - **✨new** `forceUpdate` is exposed to perform synchronous updates
  - **Types**:
    - @atlaskit/popper now exports a number of useful types from both `@popperjs/core` (`Placement`) and `react-popper`
      (`ManagerProps`, `ReferenceProps`, `PopperProps`, `PopperArrowProps`, `PopperChildrenProps`, `StrictModifier`,
      `Modifier`).
    - Custom modifiers are now more strongly typed; to improve the specificity of the types, pass a generic type with
      the modifier names you plan to use.
  - **Custom modifiers**:
    This only affects users applying custom modifiers via the `modifiers` prop:
  - the `modifiers` prop has been significantly updated:
  - The format is now an array of objects, each labelled via a `name` key:value pair. Previously the prop
    was an object where each property was the modifier name.
  - Prop options are grouped together in an `options` object
  - default boundary paddings have been removed from `preventOverflow` and `flip`; to restore original
    padding, set `padding: 5`
  - modifiers that supported a `boundariesElement` option now have two options in its place:
    - `boundary`, which takes `clippingParents` (similar to `scrollParent`)
    - `rootBoundary` which takes `viewport` or `document` (replacing `viewport` and `window`respectively)

  Each modifier has more internal changes not listed here: see [the Popper JS docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/) for more information, as well as the [Popper migration guide](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/migration-guide/) for an example of the new list structure.

  Due to the highly specific nature of these modifiers, codemod support is not provided for this change

  Note: due to a bug in `react-popper`, a console.error message relating to React `act()` may be raised on some tests. It should not cause test failures. This issue has been raised in [the React Popper issue tracker](https://github.com/popperjs/react-popper/issues/368)

### @atlaskit/popup@1.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`740e011f8d`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/740e011f8d) - This first major release of popup brings in major changes from @atlaskit/popper. These changes come with performance, maintainability and behavioral improvements.

  As popup wraps popper's functionality, these changes result in a breaking change for popup as well.

  These changes have ⚙️ codemod support:

  - ⚙️ `offset` is no longer a string, but an array of two integers (i.e. '0px 8px' is now [0, 8])
  - ⚙️ `boundariesElement` has been replaced with two props: `boundary` and `rootBoundary`. The three supported values
    from the boundariesElement prop have been split between the two as follows:

    - `boundariesElement = "scrollParents"` has been renamed: use `boundary = "clippingParents"`.
    - `boundariesElement = "window"` has been renamed: use `rootBoundary = "document"`, and acts in a similar fashion.
    - `boundariesElement = "viewport"` has been moved: use `rootBoundary = "document"`.
    - **✨new** the `boundary` prop now supports custom elements.

  - Components passed into the `content` have a change to render props:

    - ⚙️ `scheduleUpdate`, for async updates, has been renamed to `update`, and now returns a Promise.

  - For more information on the change, see [the popper.js docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/utils/detect-overflow/#boundary)

As a result, PopupSelect has some changes to the values accepted by the `popperProps` prop.

  Changes labelled with ⚙️ have codemod support:

  - ⚙️ the `positionFixed` prop has been replaced with `strategy`, which takes either `"fixed"` or `"absolute"`
  - the `modifiers` prop has been significantly updated:
    - The format is now an array of objects, each labelled via a `name` key:value pair. Previously the prop
      was an object where each property was the modifier name.
    - Prop options are grouped together in an `options` object
    - default boundary paddings have been removed from `preventOverflow` and `flip`; to restore original
