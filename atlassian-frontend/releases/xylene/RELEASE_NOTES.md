#### Major Changes

- [`37f8133702`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/37f8133702) - - Rename `AkCode` and `AkCodeBlock` exports to `Code` and `CodeBlock` respectively.
  - Remove unnecessary props (`lineNumberContainerStyle`, `showLineNumbers` and `highlight`) from `Code`.
  - Add codemods for above changes. Codemods can be found inside [codemods](./codemods) directory.
    Please use [@atlaskit/codemod-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atlaskit/codemod-cli) for running the codemods according to version of your package.
    Check its documentation [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atlaskit/codemod-cli).
  - Split exported `Theme` type into `CodeTheme` and `CodeBlockTheme`.
  - Remove `lineNumberColor` and `lineNumberBgColor` type from `CodeTheme`. They are available only in `CodeBlockTheme` now.

#### Patch Changes

- [`336f870e37`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/336f870e37) - fix exception errors of syntax highlighter for several languages

### @atlaskit/editor-common@50.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`78de49291b`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/78de49291b) - [TWISTA-130] Changes on Annotation types

  ## WHAT

  ### AnnotationState type changes

  Before:

  ```
  import { AnnotationTypes, AnnotationMarkStates } from '@atlaskit/adf-schema';

  type myAnnotationState = AnnotationState<AnnotationTypes.INLINE_COMMENT, AnnotationMarkStates>;
  ```

  Now:

  ```
  import { AnnotationTypes } from '@atlaskit/adf-schema';

  type myAnnotationState = AnnotationState<AnnotationTypes.INLINE_COMMENT>;
  ```

  ## WHY

  We are normalizing this type to be used on Renderer, and later, on Editor.

  ## HOW

  The Annotation feature is still an experiment on Renderer probably, you are not using it. So, no action requried.

- [`920d4514ad`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/920d4514ad) - ED-9601 Implement keyboard selection for block container nodes

  Add a node selection state between selection inside node and gap cursor selection when using left/right arrow keys to navigate

  Add special rules if you select a node by clicking on it - left arrow will take you inside node at start, second left will take you to left-side gap cursor; right arrow will take you straight to right-side gap cursor

  This covers nodes: code block, panel, layout, bodied extension, decision item

  This does not cover nodes: expand, table

  Further, a `cardClient` is now shipped from the same test helpers package, with up-to-date mock responses for a host of test URLs (in the format, `https://<type: 'inline' | 'block' | 'embed'>Card/<status: 'resolved' | 'unauthorised' | 'forbidden' | ...>`). Importantly _all_ selectors are powered by `testId`s part of the implementation of Smart Links in `@atlaskit/smart-card` and `@atlaskit/media-ui`.

### @atlaskit/editor-mobile-bridge@18.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`c8cf7f9419`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/c8cf7f9419) - ED-9623:

  This piece of work includes:

  - Adopting the api changes on `Renderer` to be able to open an expand that wraps a header that the user want to scroll to. This will change the bridge methods in order to have the expand opened beforehand:

    - `getContentNodeScrollOffset` -> Api is unchanged, but if the header is inside an expand, it will open the expand asynchronously.
    - **BREAKING CHANGE**: `scrollToContentNode` -> will return `void` instead of a boolean value as before, and if the header is inside an expand, it will scroll to the header once the expand is opened in such case.

  - Creating a query param `allowHeadingAnchorLinks` to enable/disable the entire feature on `Renderer`:
    - `allowHeadingAnchorLinks=false` -> will disable everything regarding headings
    - `allowHeadingAnchorLinks=true` -> will enable new nested header behaviour but the UI will not be enabled for mobile (see point bellow)
  - Disable UI for `mobile`/`comment` appearance: we need to enable the new expand behaviour but we don’t want to render the copy link button on those appearances.

#### Minor Changes

### @atlaskit/media-ui@14.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`863a41adbb`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/863a41adbb) - Drop unorthodox 'toolbar' appearance as one of the values in MediaButton's `appearance`. If you used it before just replace it with default (means, remove whole `apperance` prop definition completely)

#### Minor Changes

### @atlaskit/renderer@65.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`78de49291b`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/78de49291b) - [TWISTA-130] Implements ViewComponent prop for AnnotationProviders

  ## Breaking Change:

  ### WHAT

  AnnotationContext is not export anymore.

  before

  ```
  import { AnnotationContext } from '@atlaskit/renderer'

  ```

  ### WHY

  This was temporary until we defined the Provider.

  ### HOW

  The Annotation on Renderer was experimental. Probably, you were not using it.

  ## Minor Change:

  ### WHAT

  AnnotationProvider can receive a ViewComponent. This component will be mounted when the user clicks into an inline comment.

  - `waitForBlockCardSelection` - a predicate for when a Card Link has been rendered and selected in the Teamwork Platform Editor;
  - `waitForEmbedCardSelection` - a predicate for when an Embed Link has been rendered and selected in the Teamwork Platform Editor.

  Further, a `cardClient` is now shipped from the same test helpers package, with up-to-date mock responses for a host of test URLs (in the format, `https://<type: 'inline' | 'block' | 'embed'>Card/<status: 'resolved' | 'unauthorised' | 'forbidden' | ...>`). Importantly _all_ selectors are powered by `testId`s part of the implementation of Smart Links in `@atlaskit/smart-card` and `@atlaskit/media-ui`.

### @atlaskit/tooltip@17.0.0

#### Major Changes

- [`83586f015e`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/83586f015e) - Tooltip has been refactored to improve performance and be compliant with the lite-mode specification.

  - Removed `react-transition-group` in favor of `@atlaskit/motion` to reduce bundle size
  - Removed `react-node-resolver` because of its use of `React.findDOMNode` which has been marked as deprecated by the React team (more below...)
  - Removes analytics-next HOCs in favor of hook variant (You may need to update snapshot tests)
  - Removes all usage of HOCs
  - Replaces `styled-components` v3 with `@emotion/core` to improve runtime and bundle-size
  - If you are passing component to the `tag` prop then your component will need to expose a `ref` prop (`ref: React.Ref<HTMLElement>`).

  **Important to note:**

  Only a single element can be supplied to Tooltip as children, no plain text etc. (this has not changed from previous version).

#### Patch Changes

- [`f32a1f0ebf`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/f32a1f0ebf) - update @atlaskit/tooltip position prop to support Placement type.

#### Patch Changes

- [`6e5372dcda`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/6e5372dcda) - **Ticket:** EDM-1121

  **Changes:**

  Added integration tests across the board, asserting that a new window is opened to kick off the 3LO flow.

  - Added integration test for account connection and try another account flows for Inline Links;
  - Added integration test for account connection and try another account flows for Card Links;
  - Added integration test for account connection and try another account flows for Embed Links;
  - Aligned `data-testid`s across all buttons for all unauthenticated views for each of the above to be - `button-connect-account` for connecting account, and `button-connect-other-account` for trying with another account.

  Further, added an `AuthorizationWindow` method to the `@atlaskit/media-integration-test-helpers`, with the following methods:

  - `AuthorizationWindow.open()` - to open a window to authorize, dependent on which card state it is being activated from;
  - `AuthorizationWindow.checkUrl()` - to check if the window URL when redirected is the same as the `MOCK_URL_AUTH_PROVIDER` inside of the package for assertions which ship with our mocks;
  - `AuthorizationWindow.close()` - to close the window opened for authorization.
