        Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")
      </h4>
      <p>
        You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
        present and future Contributions submitted to Atlassian. In return,
        Atlassian will use commercially reasonable efforts to use Contributions
        to improve Atlassian's products and open source projects and to include
        your name in a list of contributors. Except for the license granted
        herein to Atlassian and recipients of software distributed by Atlassian,
        You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.
      </p>
      <p>1. Definitions.</p>
      <p>
        "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
        authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with
        Atlassian. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For
        the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct
        or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
        whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
        (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership
        of such entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation or other original
        works of authorship expressly identified in Schedule B, as well as any
        original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to
        an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Atlassian
        for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or
        managed by Atlassian (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition,
        "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
        communication sent to Atlassian or its representatives, including but
        not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code
        control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on
        behalf of, Atlassian for the purpose of discussing and improving the
        Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
        otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this Agreement, You hereby grant to Atlassian and to recipients of
        software distributed by Atlassian a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
        no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce,
        prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
        sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
        Agreement, You hereby grant to Atlassian and to recipients of software
        distributed by Atlassian a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
        no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section)
        patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
        otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
        patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the
        Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity
        institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including
        a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your
        Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes
        direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or
        Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above
        license. You represent further that each employee of the Corporation
        designated on Schedule A below (or in a subsequent written modification
        to that Schedule) is authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of the
        Corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
        creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).
      </p>
      <p>
        6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
        except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
        support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
        applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions
        on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
        either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
        or conditions of TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR
        A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
        You may submit it to Atlassian separately from any Contribution,
        identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or
        other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents,
        trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware,
        and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a
        third-party: [named here]".
      </p>
      <p>
        8. It is your responsibility to notify Atlassian when any change is
        required to the list of designated employees authorized to submit
        Contributions on behalf of the Corporation, or to the Corporation's
        Point of Contact with Atlassian.
