## ss-search-dialog-story static app

This is a static app we used to upload our storybooks to after each commit.

This is deployed whenever a change is made to the `product-search-dialog` or the `search-dialog` package.

For each commit the storybook can be accessed using the following URL: `https://ss-search-dialog-story.ap-southeast-2.dev.public.atl-paas.net/<commit_id>/index.html`.
